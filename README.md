# RbT1E32C

This is the firmware of Turcotronics Robello T1 robots ESP32-CAM module.

T1 robots are open hardware and mostly open software :-) 
They can be controlled from remotes, phones, tablets, computers, ... 
If you wish you can buy remotes, robots or parts of them from https://turcotronics.it 

For the Remo1 remote firmware check https://github.com/turcotronics/RbRemo1

## Installation

The source code requires the [installation of the ESP-IDF toolchain and development framework]
(https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/index.html)

**The source code works with the release/v4.0 branch.**

Once that is done, create a folder for your projects and set the path and environment variables of your shell:

```
cd /home/username/esp/esp-idf
. ./export.sh
cd ..
mkdir myprojects
cd myprojects
```

Clone the repository using the recursive option:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bkeevil/esp32-cam.git
cd esp32-cam
```

Compress the stylesheet, html and javascript pages in main/www:

```
cd main/www
./compress_pages.sh
cd ../..
```

From the root of the repository source tree, create a build directory and then run CMake:

```
cd /path/to/repository
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cd ..
```

Then, to configure the source code you need to run `make menuconfig` from the root of the source tree. This will bring up an ncurses based repository editor.

Important settings are:
- Select a USB port for uploading the firmware under *Serial Flasher Config -> Default serial port*
- Select what board you are using under *Camera Web Server -> Camera Pins*
- You can select default wifi settings under *Camera Web Server -> Wifi Settings*
- Under *Component Config* pin the WiFi and Bluetooth tasks to Core0
- Enable NTP and select a default NTP server and timezone under *NTP configuration*

When your settings are complete, save them and exit.

Compile the source code by executing `make app`

Flash the binary file to your ESP32 module using `make flash` 

Monitor the debug serial output by running `make monitor`


### Build Notes

Instead of using make xxxx commands, you can use idf.py xxxx commands.

```
idf.py build
idf.py menuconfig
idf.py app
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 app-flash
```


### Windows Notes

Start ESP-IDF Command Prompt from Windows Start Menu to have idf.py available automatically.
To further simplify the build process, create a build-windows-defaultcomport file (without any extension) with your devices COM port, e.g. COM15, then from within the ESP-IFD prompt run the build script.
```
echo COM15 > build-windows-defaultcomport
powershell.exe .\build-windows.ps1
```


## First Run

When the firmware first starts up, it will try to establish a wifi connection in the following order:

1. Establish a connection using the SSID and password stored in non-volatile storage (nvs)
2. Establish a connection using the default STA SSID and password provided by `make menuconfig`
3. After five failed attempts at starting in station (STA) mode, it will fall back to SoftAP mode and act as a wifi access point

To connect to the access point, point a browser to 192.168.4.1. There is no username or password.

From the web interface, select a Wifi SSID and password and optionally specify a static IP address and other network settings. Reboot the device for the settings to take effect.
